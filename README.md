## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

## Optimizations:
Things that we would have done had we more time:
- more animations

Questions we have:
- best practices when it comes to encapsulation. Ex. Should we have not put it all within the same function? Is our code properly abstracted?

## Lessons Learned:
Got a better handle on encapsulation. We placed the entire game within one function.
